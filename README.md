## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing four key soil properties to determine which metric has the greatest impact on crop productivity. By identifying the most influential feature, we aim to help optimize the decision-making process for crop selection.

Farmers are often faced with the challenge of choosing the right crops for each growing season. Their ultimate goal is to maximize yield while balancing limited resources. Key soil metrics—nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and pH level—play a crucial role in assessing soil health. However, testing all of them regularly can be costly and time-consuming.

This analysis explores which of these soil indicators is most predictive of favorable crop conditions, helping farmers prioritize which metrics to measure when constrained by time or budget. Since each crop thrives under specific soil conditions, having a clear understanding of which soil factor matters most empowers more strategic agricultural planning and improved yields.
